# Code of Conduct

1. **Universal Respect**  
   Treat every being—human, animal, rock, or cosmic dust—with the same courtesy you’d expect from the universe itself.

2. **Kind Communication**  
   Words carry weight. Speak gently, listen openly, and remember: sarcasm is for comedians, not colleagues.

3. **Shared Responsibility**  
   Our collective aim is global harmony. Act as if your choices ripple across continents, forests, and galaxies.

4. **No Abuse, Ever**  
   Physical, verbal, digital or metaphysical harm is out of bounds. Period.

5. **Embrace Diversity**  
   Differences—of species, opinion, origin or composition—make existence interesting. Celebrate them.

6. **Accountability**  
   Own your actions. Apologies are welcome; repeated offenses are not.

7. **Play Fair**  
   Cheating, exploitation or rock-hurling is discouraged in all dimensions.

8. **Have a Little Fun**  
   While we strive for peace, a dash of humor (that doesn’t hurt anyone) helps keep things light.

_By following these simple rules, we co-create a more peaceful planet—and maybe even a friendlier universe._
